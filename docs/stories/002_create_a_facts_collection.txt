002_create_a_facts_collection

As a client
I can create a collection of facts

A facts_collection has:
* an ordered list of facts
* ordered by time_stamp
* a << function that adds one fact
* the enumerable functions allow to loop over the facts
* other array functions (e.g. []) do not work (no random access)
* the << function will validate that the time_stamp is strictly larger than the most recent time_stamp in the collection
* there is no way (yet) to add "older" or "same date" facts
  (e.g. from a merge) in a facts_collection
