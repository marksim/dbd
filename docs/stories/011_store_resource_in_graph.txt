011_store_resource_in_graph.txt

* add a "add" method on Graph that will store a (Provenance)Resource instance
  (current << only works for a single fact)

* allow setting the subject and provenance_subject of a fact with set_once
  (a soft form of immutable behavior that does not require the creation of
   new objects (garbage collection cost) and may clean up the way too complex
   check_or_set_subject_and_provenance behavior in Resource)

* (maybe) change the methods << that change values to add! or
  set_subjects_on_fact_and_add or some better name.
