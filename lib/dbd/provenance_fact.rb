  # ProvenanceFact
  #
  # ProvenanceFact is derived from Fact and behaves very similar.
  #
  # The ProvenanceFacts with same subject form a ProvenanceResource and
  # this is used as the target for the provenance_subject of a Fact.
  #
  # The provenance_subject of a ProvenanceFact itself is empty, so the
  # usage of provenance_subject is not recursive on this level (this
  # allows efficient single pass loading in an underlying database).
  #
  # In the serialisation of a fact stream, the presence or absence of a
  # provenance_subject marks the difference between a (base) Fact and a
  # ProvenanceFact.
  #
  # The predicates in a ProvenanceFact would typically come from a defined
  # "provenance ontology". An experimental example of a provenance ontology
  # is built-up on https://data.vandenabeele.com/ontologies/provenance.
