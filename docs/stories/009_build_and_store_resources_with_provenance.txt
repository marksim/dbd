009_build_and_store_resources_with_provenance

As a client
I can build and store a group of resources with provenance

* rename ArrayCollection to OrderedSetCollection

* clean-up the dependency on external UUID gem

* make a FactsBySubject model
  * add subject and facts related methods

* make a FactsWithProvenance model
  * add public build methods on it

* add validations on Fact::Collection << for Fact#complete?

* rename FactsBySubject to Resource

* rename FactsWithProvenance to ResourcesWithProvenance

* on ResourcesWithProvenance model
  * add generate_subjects to generate the missing subjects and interlink

* add a store method on Graph
  * that will store a ResourcesWithProvenance instance
  * this will now set the time_stamps (enforcing the strictly monotic order)
