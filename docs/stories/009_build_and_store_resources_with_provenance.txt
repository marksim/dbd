009_build_and_store_resources_with_provenance

As a client
I can build and store a group of resources with provenance

* rename ArrayCollection to OrderedSetCollection

* clean-up the dependency on external UUID gem

* make a FactsBySubject model
  * add subject and facts related methods

* make a FactsWithProvenance model
  * add public build methods on it

* add validations on Fact::Collection << for Fact#complete?

* rename FactsBySubject to Resource

* rename FactsWithProvenance to ResourcesWithProvenance

* on Resource, enforce the presence of a subject and set it on the facts

* on Resource, enforce the presence of a provenance_subject and set it on the facts

* on ProvenanceResource, enforce the presence of a subject and set it on the facts

* rename provenance_fact_subject to provenance_subject

* change arguments for (Provenance)Resource to an options hash

* remove the ResourcesWithProvenance

* change arguments for (Provenance)Fact to an options hash

* add a << method on Graph
  * that stores a fact
  * this will now set the time_stamp (enforcing the strictly monotic order)
  * the time_stamp is a set_once property
    (a soft form of immutable behavior that does not require the creation of
     new objects (garbage collection cost).
