001_store_a_fact

As a client
I can create a data_fact

A data_fact has:
* a very fine grained date stamp
  (creating a de facto order)
* a guaranteed unique UUID
* a fact_origin UUID

* a subject ID (a UUID)
* a property (in a correct Semantic format
  as used in ontology)
* an object of format String
