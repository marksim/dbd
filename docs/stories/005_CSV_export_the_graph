005_CSV_export_the_graph

As a client
I can ask a CSV export of the graph

* a graph is built now as an (ordered) set of
  fact_origin_collections and fact_collections

* use UTF-8
* use comma's (tabs are too hard to confuse with spaces)
* use "" around strings
* use newlines at end of a row
* allow newlines in the strings inbetween ""
* try to use default Ruby CSV library

* facts are ordered by time_stamp
* fact_origins are unique on id
* each fact_origin must come before the fact it describes
* fact_origins and facts may be intermixed at random
  (only the 2 constraints above are required)
