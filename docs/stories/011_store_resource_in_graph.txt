* allow setting the subject and provenance_subject of a fact with set_once
  (a soft form of immutable behavior that does not require the creation of
   new objects (garbage collection cost) and may clean up the way too complex
   check_or_set_subject_and_provenance behavior in Resource)

* add a << method for a resource on Graph
  * that will store a (Provenance)Resource instance
  * this will now set the time_stamps (enforcing the strictly monotic order)
