  # A Resource is a collection of facts that have the same subject.
  #
  # In the real-world this is a mainly an "instance" about which all
  # facts are giving information (e.g. a conference, a person, a
  # bicycle, ...). More generally this can also be used to describe
  # classes and other concepts in the software system.
  #
  # The subject is required from the creation of a new resource.
  #
  # During build-up of a Fact, the subject can be nil. This will then
  # be set in a local duplicate when the Fact is added to a resource
  # (a subject in Dbd is a random uuid (like a oid), not a meaningful URI).
