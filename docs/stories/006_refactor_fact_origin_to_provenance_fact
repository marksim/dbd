006_refactor_fact_origin_to_provenance_fact

As a client
I can use a ProvenanceFact

* a ProvenanceFact is a subclass of a Fact
  with additional features:
  * it's time_stamp must be earlier than any Fact that
    refers to it through it's provenance_fact_id.
* a graph is represented internally as an
  ordered set of provenance_fact_collections
  and fact_collections (currently limited
  to 1 provenance_fact_collection and 1
  fact_collection)

* Facts are ordered by time_stamp
